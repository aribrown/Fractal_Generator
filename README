By: Ari Brown

------- Run ------------
Compile: clang++ -Wall -Wextra fractal.cpp -o fractal -F /Library/Frameworks -framework SDL2_image -framework SDL2

Run:
        ./fractal

---------------------------------
Many of the fractal parameters can be changed in the "INITAL VARIABLES"
section of main, which will create different effects.
This basic fractal is derived from a koch curve.
